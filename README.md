# 06-Juicy-Breakout

This is a breakout clone that I got from my college professor, with the purpose of making it "juicy." The things I have added are

1. 8 diffrent colored tiles that each have a unique point output (5-40)
2. A visual effect for hitting the paddle
3. A sound effect for hitting the paddle
4. A visual effect for dying
5. A sound effect for dying
6. A visual effect for hitting a tile
7. 4 sound effects for hitting a tile (the sound effect being choosen at random)
8. A visual effect for hitting the wall
9. 3 sound effects for hitting the wall (the sound effect being choosen at random)
10. Made it so after a certain amount of score a new ball will be added, usually the player will end up with around 4 if they don't lose any
11. Made it so the paddle shrinks each time a ball hits the paddle or a wall and grows each time a tile is hit (this resets after each life)
12. Added a background to the game
13. Made it so the ball changes color each time it hits something
14. Made it so the paddle changes color each time a ball hits something
15. Made it so that if there are still balls after one fell the game will tell you how long until the paddles size is rested. If there are no balls the game will countdown until the next ball spawns.
16. added music to the main game
17. added music to the game over screen
18. added music to the win screen
19. added colorful points that spawn when the ball hits something and stays there for the rest of the game, slowly moving.
20. added a trail to the ball that is the same color as the ball.
